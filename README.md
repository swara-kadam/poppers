# 🎈 PoPPerS

**PoPPerS** is a playful and visually satisfying task dashboard that lets you track your upcoming tasks with animated balloons floating across a pastel sky. Each balloon represents a task, drifts toward its deadline, and pops with confetti when completed!

## 🔧 How it Works

1. Add a task and set its due date.
2. A balloon appears in a lane, scaled by time until due.
3. Balloons drift slowly to the right.
4. Tasks that pass the due date turn red and stop drifting.
5. Clicking a balloon completes it with a pop animation + sound.
6. Completed tasks are saved to a historical table.
